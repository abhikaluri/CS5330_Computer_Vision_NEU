# CS 5330 Programming Assignment 0: Crash Course into Numpy

# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command: `conda env create -f pa0_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs5330_pa0'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs5330_pa0` or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs5330_pa0` or `source activate cs5330_pa0`.
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa0_code/pa0.ipynb` and finish tasks described over there.
5. Please submit your finished Jupyter notebook file to Canvas.
6. Note that you do not have to use the provided conda environment. In fact, you can use whatever environment you prefer. All we need is the finished Jupyter notebook.
