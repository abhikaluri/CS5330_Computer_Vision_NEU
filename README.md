# CS 5330 programming assignment 5: Camera Projection Matrix and Fundamental Matrix Estimation with RANSAC

# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command: `conda env create -f pa5_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs5330_pa5'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs5330_pa5` or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs5330_pa5` or `source activate cs5330_pa5`
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa5_code/pa5.ipynb` and finish tasks described over there.
5. Submit your finished Jupyter notebook file to Canvas.
